## Run a functional test of Kafka on Azure Cobalt 100 

After installing Kafka on your Arm64 virtual machine, you can perform simple baseline testing to validate that Kafka runs correctly and produces the expected output.

Kafka requires **ZooKeeper**. Since you downloaded 3.7.1 (still ships with ZooKeeper), we’ll use ZooKeeper here.

We need 5 terminals. Each one does a different job. ZooKeeper keeps things in order, Kafka runs the server, one makes a topic, one sends messages, and one reads them. This proves Kafka is working fine.

### Terminal 1 – Start ZooKeeper

This command goes into the Kafka folder and starts ZooKeeper, which is needed for Kafka to run properly. Keep this terminal open.

```console
cd /opt/kafka
bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
```

### Terminal 2 – Start Kafka Broker

This command moves into the Kafka folder and starts the **Kafka broker** (the main server that sends and receives messages). Keep this running in its own terminal.
```console
cd /opt/kafka
bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
```

### Terminal 3 – Create a Topic

This command creates a new Kafka topic named test-topic-kafka (like a channel where messages will be stored and shared) with 1 partition and 1 copy (replica).

```console
cd /opt/kafka
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic test-topic-kafka --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1
```
You should see output similar to:

```output
Created topic test-topic-kafka.
```

- **Verify topic**

```console
bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
```
You should see output similar to:

```output
__consumer_offsets
perf-test
test-topic
test-topic-kafka
test-topic-new
```

### Terminal 4 – Console Producer (Write Message)

This command starts the Kafka Producer, which lets you type and send messages into the `test-topic-kafka`. For example, you typed **hello from azure arm vm**, and this message will be delivered to any Kafka consumer subscribed to that topic.

```console
cd /opt/kafka
bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --topic test-topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
```
You should see output similar to:

```output
bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --topic test-topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
>hello from azure arm vm
>
```

### Terminal 5 – Console Consumer (Read Message)

This command starts the Kafka Consumer, which listens to the `test-topic-kafka` and displays all messages from the beginning. In your case, it showed **hello from azure arm vm**, proving that the producer’s message was successfully received.
```console
cd /opt/kafka
bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic test-topic --from-beginning --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
```

You should see output similar to:

```output
hello from azure arm vm
```
Kafka baseline test is successful — ZooKeeper and the broker are running, the producer sends messages, and the consumer receives them. 

Now you can proceed to benchmarking Kafka’s performance on the Azure Cobalt 100 Arm virtual machine.
