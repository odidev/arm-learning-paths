## Deploy a Dockerised Application on AWS ECS With Terraform
Another way to deploy Dockerised Application on AWS ECS is with Terraform. You can follow the steps here to automate your ECS deployment.

## Before you begin
You should have the prerequisite tools installed before starting the Learning Path. 

Any computer which has the required tools installed can be used for this section. The computer can be your desktop or laptop computer or a virtual machine with the required tools. 

You will need an [AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?nc2=h_ct&src=default&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fregistration-confirmation#/start) to complete this Learning Path. Create an account if you don't have one.

You will also need an IAM user with `AdministratorAccess` policy attached. Login with that user and [configure](install-guides/aws_access_keys#configure-the-aws-cli) AWS CLI.


## Create an Elastic Container Registry (ECR) on AWS ECS
ECR is an AWS service for sharing and deploying container applications. This service offers a fully managed container registry that makes the process of storing, managing, sharing, and deploying your containers easier and faster. To set up an ECR, create a `main.tf` file inside your working directory and put below code in it:

```console
# main.tf
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "4.45.0"
    }
  }
}
resource "aws_ecr_repository" "app_ecr_repo" {
  name = "myapp"
}
```

Start by running the `terraform init` command. This should be the first command executed after creating a new Terraform configuration. It creates the Terraform configuration files in your working directory.

```console
terraform init
```
The message `Terraform has been successfully initialized!` should be displayed on your terminal, as shown:

```output
Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding hashicorp/aws versions matching "4.45.0"...
- Installing hashicorp/aws v4.45.0...
- Installed hashicorp/aws v4.45.0 (signed by HashiCorp)

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```

To create an ECR, run the `plan` command, you’ll be able to preview the above Terraform configuration file and the resource that will be created:

```console
terraform plan
```
Terraform plan will let you see the resource that will be added, changed, or deployed to AWS. In this case, one resource `aws_ecr_repository.app_ecr_repo`, will be added to AWS.

```output
Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following
symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_ecr_repository.app_ecr_repo will be created
  + resource "aws_ecr_repository" "app_ecr_repo" {
      + arn                  = (known after apply)
      + id                   = (known after apply)
      + image_tag_mutability = "MUTABLE"
      + name                 = "myapp"
      + registry_id          = (known after apply)
      + repository_url       = (known after apply)
      + tags_all             = (known after apply)
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
```

To provision the displayed configuration infrastructure on AWS, apply the above execution plan:

```console
terraform apply
```
Enter yes when prompted to allow Terraform to execute this command as expected.

```output
Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following
symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_ecr_repository.app_ecr_repo will be created
  + resource "aws_ecr_repository" "app_ecr_repo" {
      + arn                  = (known after apply)
      + id                   = (known after apply)
      + image_tag_mutability = "MUTABLE"
      + name                 = "my-app-terraform"
      + registry_id          = (known after apply)
      + repository_url       = (known after apply)
      + tags_all             = (known after apply)
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
aws_ecr_repository.app_ecr_repo: Creating...
aws_ecr_repository.app_ecr_repo: Creation complete after 0s [id=myapp]

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

Terraform will create the ECR. You can confirm this on your Amazon Elastic Container Registry Repositories list.

Now that you have an ECR repository ready, it’s time to create the Docker image and upload it to ECR. Follow below steps to do so:
* [Create the Docker image](/learning-paths/server-and-cloud/ecs/deployment#create-the-docker-image)
* [Give the Docker CLI permission to access of your Amazon account](/learning-paths/server-and-cloud/ecs/deployment#give-the-docker-cli-permission-to-access-of-your-amazon-account)
* [Upload your docker image to ECR](/learning-paths/server-and-cloud/ecs/deployment#upload-your-docker-image-to-ecr)

Finally, refresh the repository’s page to verify you’ve successfully pushed the image to the AWS ECR repository.

![image](https://github.com/akhandpuresoftware/arm-learning-paths/assets/87687468/cc056b76-edca-49d0-af4f-de989999f071)

## Create an ECS Cluster
So far, you’ve created a repository and deployed the image. But whenever you want to launch, you’ll need a target. A cluster acts as the container target. It takes a task into the cluster configuration and runs that task within the cluster.
To create a cluster where you’ll run your task, add the following configurations to your main.tf file:

```console
# main.tf
resource "aws_ecs_cluster" "my_cluster" {
  name = "app-cluster" # Name your cluster here
}
```
This will instruct ECS to create a new cluster named app-cluster. Re-run the apply command to add these changes to AWS:

```console
terraform apply
```
Head over to Amazon ECS Clusters, and verify that you can see these changes:

![image](https://github.com/akhandpuresoftware/arm-learning-paths/assets/87687468/136f3ec4-b7ca-4f73-a988-7d35e2a23b18)

## Configure AWS ECS Task Definition
The image is now hosted in the ECR, but to run the image, you need to launch it onto an ECS container.
To deploy the image to ECS, you first need to create a task. A task tells ECS how you want to spin up your Docker container. A task is a true blueprint for your application. It describes the container’s critical specifications of how to launch your application container. These specifications include:

* Port mappings
* Application image
* CPU and RAM resources
* Container launch types such as EC2 or Fargate

An AWS ECS workload has two main launch types: EC2 and Fargate.
Fargate is an AWS orchestration tool. It allows you to give AWS the role of managing your container lifecycle and the hosting infrastructure. Fargate runs your container as serverless, which means you don’t need to provision your container using EC2 instances. Instead of using the ECS clusters to run your container, you can use Fargate to spin up and run your container on ECS without provisioning a virtual machine on AWS.
Add below configuration in your `main.tf`:

```console
# main.tf
resource "aws_ecs_task_definition" "app_task" {
  family                   = "app-first-task" # Name your task
  container_definitions    = <<DEFINITION
  [
    {
      "name": "app-first-task",
      "image": "${aws_ecr_repository.app_ecr_repo.repository_url}",
      "essential": true,
      "portMappings": [
        {
          "containerPort": 80,
          "hostPort": 80
        }
      ],
      "memory": 512,
      "cpu": 256
    }
  ]
  DEFINITION
  requires_compatibilities = ["FARGATE"] # use Fargate as the launch type
  network_mode             = "awsvpc"    # add the AWS VPN network mode as this is required for Fargate
  memory                   = 512         # Specify the memory the container requires
  cpu                      = 256         # Specify the CPU the container requires
  execution_role_arn       = "${aws_iam_role.ecsTaskExecutionRole.arn}"
}
```
{{% notice Note %}} Change `containerPort`, `hostPort`, `memory` & `cpu` as per your requirment.{{% /notice %}}

As described in the above config block, Terraform will create a task named app-first-task and also assign the resources needed to power up the container through this task. This process includes assigning the deployed image, container ports, launch type, and the hardware requirements that the container needs to run.
Creating a task definition requires `ecsTaskExecutionRole` to be added to your IAM. The above task definition needs this role, and it is specified as `aws_iam_role.ecsTaskExecutionRole.arn`. In the next step, create a resource to execute this role as follows:

```console
# main.tf
resource "aws_iam_role" "ecsTaskExecutionRole" {
  name               = "ecsTaskExecutionRole"
  assume_role_policy = "${data.aws_iam_policy_document.assume_role_policy.json}"
}

data "aws_iam_policy_document" "assume_role_policy" {
  statement {
    actions = ["sts:AssumeRole"]

    principals {
      type        = "Service"
      identifiers = ["ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com"]
    }
  }
}

resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "ecsTaskExecutionRole_policy" {
  role       = "${aws_iam_role.ecsTaskExecutionRole.name}"
  policy_arn = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy"
}
```
Run `terraform apply` to add these changes to AWS. Navigate to Amazon ECS Task Definitions, and these changes should reflect as such:

![image](https://github.com/akhandpuresoftware/arm-learning-paths/assets/87687468/f39983c4-233f-4eb5-af48-7884aaaa881c)

## Launch the Container
At this point, AWS has most of the configurations needed. However, you need to connect all the above-created specifications together to launch your container successfully.

### Create a VPC
First, you need to create a Virtual Private Cloud Module (VPC) and subnet to launch your cluster into. VPC and subnet allow you to connect to the internet, communicate with ECS, and expose the application to available zones.
Go ahead and create a default VPC and subnets information for your AWS availability zones.

```console
# main.tf
# Provide a reference to your default VPC
resource "aws_default_vpc" "default_vpc" {
}

# Provide references to your default subnets
resource "aws_default_subnet" "default_subnet_a" {
  # Use your own region here but reference to subnet 1a
  availability_zone = "us-east-2a"
}

resource "aws_default_subnet" "default_subnet_b" {
  # Use your own region here but reference to subnet 1b
  availability_zone = "us-east-2b"
}
```

### Implement a Load Balancer
Next, create a security group that will route the HTTP traffic using a load balancer. Go ahead and implement a load balancer as follows:

```console
# main.tf
resource "aws_alb" "application_load_balancer" {
  name               = "load-balancer-dev" #load balancer name
  load_balancer_type = "application"
  subnets = [ # Referencing the default subnets
    "${aws_default_subnet.default_subnet_a.id}",
    "${aws_default_subnet.default_subnet_b.id}"
  ]
  # security group
  security_groups = ["${aws_security_group.load_balancer_security_group.id}"]
}
```
The above configuration creates a load balancer that will distribute the workloads across multiple resources to ensure application’s availability, scalability, and security.

### Create a Security Group for the Load Balancer
The next important part of allowing HTTP traffic to access the ECS cluster is to create a security group. This will be crucial for accessing the application later in this guide. Go ahead and add the security group for the load balancer as follows:

```console
# main.tf
# Create a security group for the load balancer:
resource "aws_security_group" "load_balancer_security_group" {
  ingress {
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"] # Allow traffic in from all sources
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}
```

Configure the load balancer with the VPC networking we created earlier. This will distribute the balancer traffic to the available zone:

```console
# main.tf
resource "aws_lb_target_group" "target_group" {
  name        = "target-group"
  port        = 80
  protocol    = "HTTP"
  target_type = "ip"
  vpc_id      = "${aws_default_vpc.default_vpc.id}" # default VPC
}

resource "aws_lb_listener" "listener" {
  load_balancer_arn = "${aws_alb.application_load_balancer.arn}" #  load balancer
  port              = "80"
  protocol          = "HTTP"
  default_action {
    type             = "forward"
    target_group_arn = "${aws_lb_target_group.target_group.arn}" # target group
  }
}
```
### Create an ECS Service
The last step is to create an ECS Service and its details to maintain task definition in an Amazon ECS cluster. The service will run the cluster, task, and Fargate behind the created load balancer to distribute traffic across the containers that are associated with the service. You can achieve this with the following block:

```console
# main.tf
resource "aws_ecs_service" "app_service" {
  name            = "app-first-service"     # Name the service
  cluster         = "${aws_ecs_cluster.my_cluster.id}"   # Reference the created Cluster
  task_definition = "${aws_ecs_task_definition.app_task.arn}" # Reference the task that the service will spin up
  launch_type     = "FARGATE"
  desired_count   = 3 # Set up the number of containers to 3

  load_balancer {
    target_group_arn = "${aws_lb_target_group.target_group.arn}" # Reference the target group
    container_name   = "${aws_ecs_task_definition.app_task.family}"
    container_port   = 80 # Specify the container port
  }

  network_configuration {
    subnets          = ["${aws_default_subnet.default_subnet_a.id}", "${aws_default_subnet.default_subnet_b.id}"]
    assign_public_ip = true     # Provide the containers with public IPs
    security_groups  = ["${aws_security_group.service_security_group.id}"] # Set up the security group
  }
}
```

To access the ECS service over HTTP while ensuring the VPC is more secure, create security groups that will only allow the traffic from the created load balancer. To do so, create a `aws_security_group.service_security_group` resource as follows:

```console
# main.tf
resource "aws_security_group" "service_security_group" {
  ingress {
    from_port = 0
    to_port   = 0
    protocol  = "-1"
    # Only allowing traffic in from the load balancer security group
    security_groups = ["${aws_security_group.load_balancer_security_group.id}"]
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}
```
Additionally, add an output config that will extract the load balancer URL value from the state file and log it onto the terminal.

```console
# main.tf
#Log the load balancer app URL
output "app_url" {
  value = aws_alb.application_load_balancer.dns_name
}
```
At this point, Terraform is set to create and provision infrastructure on AWS ECS. Go ahead and run the following commands:

* `terraform validate`: This allows you to detect syntax errors, version errors, and other problems associated with your Terraform module (main.tf).

```console
terraform validate
```

* `terraform plan`: Running this command gives you the ability to observe what Terraform will actually perform and what resources it will create.

```console
terraform plan
```
* `terraform apply`: This uses your configuration to provision infrastructure on AWS. Remember to enter yes when prompted to do so.

```console
terraform apply
```
After this, You should see the application’s URL on your terminal.

```output
Plan: 9 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Note that you can get a `503 Service Temporarily Unavailable` if you test your application immediately after running the `terraform apply` command. Give the infrastructure a few seconds to bring all components online.

To destroy this dev infrastructure and avoid AWS additional costs, run the following command:

```console
terraform destroy
```
